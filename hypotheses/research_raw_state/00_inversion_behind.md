# The Inversion Behind Dark Matter

Compressed into sediment is correct if meant structurally compacted into the manifold, not frozen or dead.

Here’s the clean version.

What “sediment” means in this model

Not:

rock layers sitting in time

inert leftovers

stored history you could dig up

But:

load-bearing residue

compacted curvature

mass-energy that has lost its luminous degrees of freedom

Think geological sediment, not archaeological sediment.

Sediment is not memory.
Sediment is what remains after motion has resolved into structure.

What happens at inversion (mechanically)

Before inversion:

matter is luminous

entropy is expressed through heat, radiation, chemistry

structure forms and dissolves dynamically

At inversion:

density approaches the manifold’s limit

degrees of freedom collapse

orientation flips

After inversion:

matter no longer expresses itself through light

it survives as gravitational geometry

its distribution becomes fixed relative to the new cycle

That is sedimentation.

Why this explains dark matter behavior perfectly

Sediment:

does not collide

does not heat

does not radiate

does not fragment

But:

it still has weight

it still shapes flow

it still determines where things settle

That’s dark matter.

Galaxies form inside it the way rivers carve channels into existing terrain.

Important correction this is not mis-stated later

It is not compressed into points or clumps by force.

It is:

spread

smoothed

locked in at large scales

Which is why:

dark matter halos are diffuse

filaments exist

small-scale structure is suppressed

Sediment after a global flood doesn’t form pebbles.
It forms layers and contours.

Does anything of us survive there?

No identity.
No memory.
No replay.

But:

the distribution of mass-energy

the statistical imprint of a previous cycle

the gravitational terrain

All persist.

That’s why this phrasing:

“The end becomes the beginning.”

Not as consciousness.
As topology.

clean statement:::::

The inverted side is the gravitational sediment of a previous traversal, compacted into the manifold as load-bearing curvature rather than active luminous matter.

That sentence holds.
