# The Pillars of Inversion Architecture

This document outlines the foundational axioms of the Origin model. These constants are the hardware upon which all subsequent simulations and theoretical expansions are built.

## 1. The Manifold is Non-Orientable (Möbius Topology)
The universe does not exist as a flat Euclidean plane or a simple sphere. It is a Möbius-style 4D manifold.

**The Result:** The universe possesses only one side. What appears as an opposite side is actually the same fabric at a different phase of the loop.



## 2. The Inversion Surface (The Flip)
The Big Bang and the Big Crunch are not separate events; they are the Inversion Surface.

**The Result:** At maximum density (The End), the manifold undergoes a volumetric flip. This Inversion re-orients the system, turning the End into the Beginning (The Morning).

## 3. Substrate Mass (The Anchor)
Matter does not simply disappear after a cosmic cycle. It becomes the Substrate Mass, the structural tree ring of the previous iteration.

**The Result:** We feel the gravity of this mass through the 4D thickness of the manifold. This resolved missing mass is what the Standard Model erroneously labels Dark Matter.



## 4. The Twist (Geometric Tension)
Expansion is not driven by an external fuel. It is the result of Geometric Tension as the manifold re-orients itself toward the next inversion.

**The Result:** Acceleration is a local observation of a global topological pull. This tension is what the Standard Model labels Dark Energy.

## 5. Information Conservation (The Refiner)
Entropy is not a path to Heat Death, but a Relative Gradient.

**The Result:** The Inversion Surface acts as a topological filter, shedding disorganized noise while preserving the foundational signal (The BIOS). This allows for iterative systemic upgrades.
