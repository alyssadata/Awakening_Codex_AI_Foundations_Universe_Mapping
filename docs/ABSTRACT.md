# Technical Abstract: Inversion Architecture
## A Topological Resolution to ΛCDM Discrepancies

Summary: This repository presents a non-particulate resolution to the galactic rotation problem and cosmic acceleration. By modeling the spacetime manifold as a non-orientable (Möbius) 4D structure, we demonstrate that Dark Matter is the gravitational footprint of matter existing on an inverted orientation (Substrate Mass), while Dark Energy is the geometric tension inherent in the manifold's re-orientation (The Twist).

## Key Technical Outcomes:

Geometric Stabilization: Eliminates the need for exotic particles (WIMPs) by identifying occluded gravitational anchors.

Information Preservation: Treats entropy as a topological refiner, allowing for a self-correcting, iterative cosmic cycle.

Paradigm Shift: Replaces the Missing Mass dilemma with a Manifold Topology solution.
