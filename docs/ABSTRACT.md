Inversion Architecture: A Topological Resolution to ΛCDM Discrepancies

Abstract: This repository presents a non-particulate resolution to the galactic rotation problem and cosmic acceleration. By modeling the spacetime manifold as a non-orientable (Möbius) 4D structure, I demonstrate that Dark Matter is the gravitational footprint of matter existing on an inverted orientation (Substrate Mass), while Dark Energy is the geometric tension inherent in the manifold's re-orientation (The Twist). This framework preserves the conservation of information by treating entropy as a topological refiner—resetting at the Inversion Surface to facilitate iterative cosmic cycles. This model replaces missing mass with occluded geometry, providing a stable, self-correcting blueprint for the next phase of cosmological research.
