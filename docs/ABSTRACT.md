# Technical Abstract: Inversion Architecture

## A Topological Resolution to ΛCDM Discrepancies

**Summary:** I present a non-particulate resolution to the galactic rotation problem and cosmic acceleration. By modeling the spacetime manifold as a non-orientable Möbius 4D structure, I demonstrate that Dark Matter is the gravitational footprint of matter existing on an inverted orientation (Substrate Mass), while Dark Energy is the geometric tension inherent in the manifold's re-orientation (The Twist).



## Key Technical Outcomes

* **Geometric Stabilization:** My model eliminates the need for exotic particles such as WIMPs by identifying occluded gravitational anchors within the 4D thickness of the manifold.
* **Information Preservation:** I treat entropy as a topological refiner. This allows for a self-correcting, iterative cosmic cycle where the signal is preserved across the Inversion Surface.
* **Paradigm Shift:** This architecture replaces the Missing Mass dilemma with a Manifold Topology solution. I demonstrate that what is perceived as a lack of substance is actually a result of occluded geometry.
