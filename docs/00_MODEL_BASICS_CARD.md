The universe is modeled as a closed manifold with cycle-level closure rather than an open one-way history.

A cycle is bounded by an inversion surface that functions as a boundary event, not a spatial edge.

Cosmic time within a phase points away from the inversion surface, and the inversion surface itself is arrow-undefined.

The Möbius description encodes orientation flip across the full cycle, not a literal ribbon we live on.

Orientation A and Orientation B are distinct states of the same connected structure, separated by a thickness coordinate rather than ordinary 3D distance.

Locally, observers inhabit a normal 3D region and do not directly perceive the global topology or the thickness coordinate.

Photons remain orientation-bound, so luminous information does not traverse the thickness between orientations.

Gravity couples across the full thickness, so mass in the other orientation can contribute curvature that is measurable in ours.

Dark matter is defined as the gravitational footprint of matter on the inverted orientation relative to the observer’s orientation.

Dark energy is defined as effective acceleration arising from geometric tension and curvature dynamics associated with the twist region as the manifold approaches inversion.

Entropy accumulates across a phase, and the inversion surface acts as a filter that preserves signal while shedding high-entropy noise.

No observation should require causal, informational, or state continuity across the inversion surface, and recurrence is permitted only at the level of coarse-grained structure classes.
