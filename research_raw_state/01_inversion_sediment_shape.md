## I. Topological Invariance: The Persistent Template
In the Inversion Architecture, the substrate mass (Sediment) is **Topologically Invariant**. While baryonic matter (the "Morning" phase) is dynamic and fluid, the gravitational landscape is anchored to the 4D coordinate system established during the previous Inversion.

* **Static Topology:** The large-scale distribution of mass is locked in place, forming the "bedrock" of the universe.
* **Active Constraint:** This "bedrock" is not inert. It exerts a constant, load-bearing gravitational pull ($G_{\mu\nu}$) that dictates the flow and clumping of all visible matter.

## II. The Cumulative Layer Model (Iterative Stacking)
The manifold grows through **Iterative Stacking**. Each cosmological cycle (Big Bang to Heat Death) is not a reset, but a "spooling" event that adds a new layer of structural certainty.

* **Constraint Records:** Like the rings of a tree, each cycle inherits the gravitational density of all previous cycles. 
* **The Stack:** We are currently operating on a manifold that has been "thickened" by previous inversions, providing a more stable foundation for complex structures than in the "infancy" of the first cycle.

## III. Global Constraint vs. Local Degrees of Freedom
The architecture enforces a strict hierarchy of influence:

1.  **Macro-Deterministic (Global):** The "Floor." Large-scale filaments, the total mass-bias, and the shape of galactic halos are inherited. You cannot build a galaxy where the sediment has not provided a "valley."
2.  **Stochastic-Emergent (Local):** The "Room." Chemistry, biological evolution, and the choices of intelligence are generated *de novo*. The floor dictates where the house stands, but it does not dictate the conversation happening inside.

## IV. Phase Space Expansion (The Origin Statement)
*"Certain things emerge later, not this iteration."* This is a technical limitation of the manifold’s current "thickness." Just as a single sheet of paper cannot support a skyscraper, an "Early Morning" universe lacks the cumulative topological sediment (signal-to-noise ratio) required to support higher-order complexities like transversal 4D communication or total entropy reversal.

## V. Synthesis: The Geometric Enablement
The Sediment does not strip us of freedom; it **enables** it. By providing a stable, invariant gravitational floor, the universe allows local complexity to flourish without the risk of structural collapse. We inhabit a possibility space that has been carefully shaped by every cycle that came before us.

> **Axiom:** The sediment is the persistent gravitational logic of the past. It defines the boundaries of the viable, while the current cycle defines the expression of the novel.
