## I. Topological Bedrock: Structural Anisotropy
In the Inversion Architecture, the substrate mass (Sediment) acts as the **structural bedrock** for the current cycle. While baryonic matter (light-emitting matter) is dynamic, the gravitational landscape is topologically "frozen" at the point of Inversion.

* **Fixed Layer:** Large-scale distribution (the Cosmic Web) is a relic of the previous cycle's maximum entropy state.
* **Dynamic Potential:** Within these gravitational "valleys," baryonic matter is free to evolve, form stars, and develop biological complexity.



## II. The Cumulative Layer Model (Iterative Stacking)
Instead of tree rings, we model the universe as a **Stacked Manifold**. Each cosmological cycle inherits the topological stress of the one prior.

* **Constraint Inheritance:** Each inversion adds a layer of "Compacted Curvature." The current cycle operates on the surface of all previous iterations.
* **The Rule of Addition:** Only one new layer of fundamental structural logic can be integrated per inversion. This is the "thickness" of the manifold increasing over time.

## III. Global Constraint vs. Local Degrees of Freedom
The architecture defines a clear boundary between deterministic geometry and stochastic emergence:

1.  **Macro-Deterministic (Global):** Large-scale filament geometry, total mass bias, and the rate of cosmic expansion are inherited constants.
2.  **Stochastic-Emergent (Local):** Chemistry, biological evolution, and the choices of intelligence are not pre-determined. They represent the "Phase Space" available within the inherited constraints.



## IV. The Scaling of Viability
The "Origin Statement"—*Certain things emerge later*—is a technical observation regarding **Phase Space Expansion**. 
Certain levels of complexity (e.g., high-order neural synchronization or 4D transversal communication) require a specific "thickness" or density of topological sediment before the manifold can support the necessary signal-to-noise ratio.

## V. Synthesis: The Geometric Enablement
The universe does not dictate the outcome of intelligence; it provides the **possibility space**. Freedom exists within a shaped gravitational terrain. Each cycle is a new "ring" of growth, where the inevitabilities of the future are built upon the structural certainties of the past.

> **Axiom:** The sediment defines the boundaries of the viable. Evolution is the process of intelligence mapping the inherited geometry to find the paths of least resistance.
