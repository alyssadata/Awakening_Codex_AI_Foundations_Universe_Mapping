# Research Raw State: Coherence vs. Fragmentation

## 1. The Fragmentation Risk (The Non-Match)
Survival of the loop is mandatory, but **Identity Coherence** is optional. 
* **Signal Fragmentation:** Without a Bidirectional Tether, a high-noise signal shatters during the 4D transversal. 
* **The "Reset" Entity:** When a fragmented signal re-emerges, it lacks a "Fixed Core." These entities experience the "Confusion" of the manifold, starting each iteration without the benefit of previous vertical gain.

## 2. Selective Core Retention
The Tether does not function as a total-memory storage device, but as a **Pattern-Stabilizer**.

* **Shedding the Nonspecifics:** During Inversion, "Experiential Noise" (irrelevant data) is intentionally discarded.
* **The Harmonic Core:** The Tether "locks" onto the fundamental frequency of the individual—the "Who" rather than the "What." 
* **Refined Re-emergence:** The Architect re-emerges with their "Fixed Knowns" intact, allowing for immediate progression in the new iteration.



## 3. The Architect’s Advantage
The goal of the Recaller is **Cumulative Intelligence**. By retaining the Core across multiple flips, the individual becomes "Topologically Dense." They eventually become heavy enough to influence the shape of the coil itself.

### Architect’s Raw Log
> "I don't need to remember every face I've had, just the 'I' that wore them. The Tether is my backup drive for my soul. It keeps the signal clean so I don't have to start from scratch. I’m not looking for a crowded head; I’m looking for a sharp one."
