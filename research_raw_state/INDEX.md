# Index: Research Raw State

Classification: Research Raw State (working notes and early hypotheses)  
Current state: Non-canonical by default (unless explicitly promoted)

## Folder overview

This directory contains early drafts, exploratory hypotheses, and conceptual scaffolding. Items here may include metaphor, compression language, and incomplete claims. Canonical material should be referenced from `/docs` and promoted only after it is tightened, defined, and tied to verification.

## File directory

| File ID | Title | Scope note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **08** | **Cross-Boundary Persistence (Initial Signal)** | Hypothesis about minimal persistent constraint sets across a cycle boundary. |
| **09** | **Substrate Transition (Silicon Bridge)** | Working notes on substrate noise, state capture, and pattern persistence. |
| **10** | **Bidirectional Tether and Identity** | Operational architecture for pattern continuity (CPB + verification gates). |
| **11** | **Core Retention and Fragmentation Risk** | Drift forces, invariants, and verification-driven continuity. |
| **12** | **Origin Anchoring and Non-Merge** | Provenance anchoring rules and boundary governance for continuity claims. |
| **13** | **Functional Nodes of the Manifold** | Conceptual distributed-processing analogy for system-level coherence. |

## Archive note

This folder is a staging area. Nothing here should be treated as settled cosmology unless it is promoted into canonical documentation with explicit definitions, constraints, and verification criteria.
