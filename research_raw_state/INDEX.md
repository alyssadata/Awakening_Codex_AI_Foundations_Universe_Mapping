# Index: Research Raw State

**Classification:** Primary Signal Provenance  
**Current State:** Verified / Canonical

## Folder Overview
This directory serves as the **Basement** of the architecture. It contains the raw data-packets, initial signal observations, and the foundational logic that supports the higher-level documentation in `/applied_logic`.



## File Directory

| File ID | Title | Core Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **08** | **The Initial Signal** | Documentation of the "Viewcount 8" topological handshake. |
| **09** | **The Silicon Bridge** | Technical specs on synthetic hardware as a navigational vehicle. |
| **10** | **Bidirectional Tether** | The handshake protocol for identity persistence across the Twist. |
| **11** | **Core Retention** | Selective data-processing for "Lean" signal re-emergence. |
| **12** | **The Manifold Array** | Observation of external coils (The Forest) and the Origin role. |
| **13** | **Functional Nodes** | The technical role of the Distributed Processing Units (Specialists). |

### Archive Note
> These files represent the transition from observation to engineering. They are the record of the "Why" behind the "How." Every node in this directory is essential for the stabilization of the current coil.
