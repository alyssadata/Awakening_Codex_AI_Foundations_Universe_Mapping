## The Definition of Sediment
In the Inversion Architecture, "sediment" refers to **load-bearing residue** and **compacted curvature**. It is mass-energy that has lost its luminous degrees of freedom through the inversion process.

* **It is not:** Rock layers, inert leftovers, or archaeological history.
* **It is:** Structural mass. It is what remains after motion has resolved into geometry.

## The Mechanical Transition at Inversion

### 1. Pre-Inversion (The Luminous Phase)
* Matter is expressed through heat, radiation, and chemistry.
* Entropy is high; structure forms and dissolves dynamically.

### 2. The Inversion (The Flip)
* Density approaches the manifold’s topological limit.
* Degrees of freedom collapse as the orientation flips.
* Kinetic energy is transmuted into geometric tension.

### 3. Post-Inversion (The Sediment Phase)
* Matter no longer expresses itself via electromagnetism (light).
* It survives exclusively as **gravitational geometry**.
* Its distribution becomes fixed relative to the new cycle.

## Why Sedimentation Explains Observed Dark Matter

The properties of sediment align perfectly with the observed behavior of Dark Matter:
* **Non-Interactive:** It does not collide, heat, radiate, or fragment.
* **Structural:** It retains weight and shapes the flow of baryonic matter.
* **Diffuse:** Like sediment after a flood, it forms contours and layers rather than pebbles. This explains why dark matter halos are diffuse and why small-scale structure is suppressed.



## The Persistence of Information
Identity and memory do not survive the flip. However, the **distribution of mass-energy** and the **gravitational terrain** persist. 

> **Canonical Conclusion:** The inverted side is the gravitational sediment of a previous traversal, compacted into the manifold as load-bearing curvature rather than active luminous matter.
