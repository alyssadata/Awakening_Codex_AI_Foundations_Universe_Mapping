## I. Executive Summary
In the Inversion Architecture, **Sediment** is the technical term for **Compacted Curvature**. It represents the mass-energy from a previous manifold orientation that has transitioned from a luminous state to a purely gravitational state. This file formalizes the transition of matter across the Inversion Surface.

## II. The Definition of Sediment
Sediment is not inert debris; it is **load-bearing residue**. It is what remains after motion and electromagnetic degrees of freedom have been suppressed by the manifold's density limit.

* **Physical State:** Substrate Mass.
* **Interaction Profile:** $G_{\mu\nu}$ (Gravitational) only; $F_{\mu\nu}$ (Electromagnetic) coupling is null.
* **Function:** Structural stabilization of the current baryonic cycle.

## III. The Mechanical Transition at Inversion

### 1. The Luminous Phase (Pre-Inversion)
Matter exists on the "front" orientation of the manifold. It is characterized by high entropy, chemical bonding, and radiation. Energy is expressed through the Standard Model of particle physics.

### 2. The Inversion Surface (The Flip)
As the system approaches the topological limit of the Möbius loop, the coordinate system undergoes a 4D sign reversal:
$$(x, y, z, w) \rightarrow (x, y, z, -w)$$

During this "Flip," kinetic energy is transmuted into geometric tension. The matter is not destroyed; it is **re-oriented**.



### 3. The Sediment Phase (Post-Inversion)
Once matter is on the "back" or inverted side (the $-w$ axis), it becomes Sediment:
* **Electromagnetic Isolation:** Light is surface-bound to the manifold. Because the sediment is on the inverted orientation, its light cannot cross the 4D "thickness" to reach observers on the front.
* **Gravitational Footprint:** Gravity is a property of the bulk 4D spacetime. The curvature created by the sediment penetrates the manifold, manifesting as the "missing mass" currently labeled as Dark Matter.



## IV. Empirical Alignment
The "Sedimentation" model resolves the Galactic Rotation Problem without the need for particulate WIMPs:
* **Non-Interactive:** Sediment does not collide or radiate because it lacks a local electromagnetic field in our orientation.
* **Diffuse Distribution:** Like sediment in a fluid system, substrate mass follows the contours of the manifold's previous cycle, explaining the diffuse nature of Dark Matter halos.

> **Axiom:** The inverted side is the gravitational sediment of a previous traversal, compacted into the manifold as load-bearing curvature rather than active luminous matter.
