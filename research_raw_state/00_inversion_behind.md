Subject: Defining sediment in the context of substrate mass

## I. Executive Summary

In the Inversion Architecture, sediment refers to compacted curvature. It represents mass-energy associated with a prior manifold orientation that is no longer electromagnetically observable in our orientation but remains gravitationally coupled. This file formalizes the proposed transition of matter across the inversion boundary.

## II. Definition of Sediment

Sediment is load-bearing residue in the geometric sense. It is what remains when electromagnetic observability and ordinary radiative degrees of freedom are no longer available to the matter from the perspective of our orientation.

Physical state: substrate mass.  
Interaction profile: gravitational coupling only (Einstein tensor G_{μν}); electromagnetic coupling in our orientation is effectively absent (F_{μν}).  
Function: contributes to gravitational stabilization of baryonic structure in the current cycle.

## III. Mechanical Transition at Inversion

### 1. Luminous Phase (Pre-inversion)

Matter exists in the locally observable orientation. It supports electromagnetic interactions, radiation, and ordinary Standard Model phenomenology.

### 2. Inversion Boundary (Re-orientation)

At the density limit associated with the global topology, the coordinate description is modeled as a sign reversal along the manifold orientation coordinate:

(x, y, z, w) → (x, y, z, −w)

In this description, matter is not destroyed. It is re-mapped into the opposite orientation.

### 3. Sediment Phase (Post-inversion)

After re-orientation, matter is treated as sediment (substrate mass) relative to observers confined to the original orientation.

Electromagnetic isolation: electromagnetic propagation is treated as orientation-bound, so photons associated with the re-oriented matter do not traverse the manifold’s effective thickness into our orientation.

Gravitational footprint: gravity, as curvature, couples through manifold connectivity. Curvature produced by substrate mass remains observable as an additional gravitational contribution, appearing as the “missing mass” attributed to dark matter.

## IV. Empirical Alignment (Qualitative)

This sedimentation framing is intended to reproduce the broad phenomenology of dark matter without requiring a new particulate component.

Non-interactive in our orientation: substrate mass does not radiate into our orientation if electromagnetic observability is orientation-bound.

Diffuse distribution: if substrate mass traces large-scale prior-cycle geometry, it may naturally form extended halo-like gravitational profiles rather than compact luminous structures.

## Working axiom

The inverted orientation acts as gravitational sediment from a prior traversal, expressed as load-bearing curvature rather than electromagnetically observable matter in our orientation.
