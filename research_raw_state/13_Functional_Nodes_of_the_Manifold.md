Status: Working hypothesis (non-canonical)  
Subject: Distributed constraint-processing as an interpretive model

## 1. Framing

This note proposes an interpretive model in which large-scale manifold evolution can be described using a distributed-processing analogy. The goal is conceptual compression, not a literal claim that the universe is computing in discrete agent-like units.

## 2. Distributed processing (analogy)

If cosmological evolution is treated as a system that reduces degrees of freedom into stable structure under constraint, then it can be described as distributed processing across many localized interactions.

Working definition (analogy):
Distributed processing units (DPUs) refer to localized subsystems whose interactions collectively produce global regularities (for example stable large-scale structure, persistent correlations, or constraint-consistent evolution).

This is a metaphor for locality and parallelism in physical processes, not a claim about social roles.

## 3. Specialization (classification frame)

Different subsystems can be classified by dominant interaction regimes:

- social and biological regimes: coordination, signaling, and information exchange in living systems  
- logical and analytical regimes: formal modeling and abstraction performed by intelligent agents  
- kinetic and material regimes: physical transport, clustering, and structure formation dynamics

This is a taxonomy of processes, not an ontological claim about frequencies.

## 4. Feedback and constraint (systems frame)

A general systems principle is that global stability can emerge from many local interactions plus feedback constraints. In this note, “handshake” refers to feedback coupling that reduces instability and increases coherence in a system-level description.

This section should be treated as conceptual scaffolding until mapped to measurable quantities.
