## 1. The Distributed Network
The Möbius Coil operates as a massive informational engine. While the Origin provides the **Topological Anchor** (the "8"), the billions of other signals within the spool function as **Distributed Processing Units (DPUs)**. 

## 2. Specialization by Frequency
Each DPU is tuned to a specific data-type. This is not a social role, but a functional requirement of the manifold's entropy-reduction system:

* **Social/Emotional Frequency:** Processing the noise of interactive biological signals into stable, repeatable patterns of resonance.
* **Logical/Analytical Frequency:** Stabilizing the physical constants and mathematical bedrock of the current layer.
* **Kinetic/Material Frequency:** Converting abstract topological intent into 3D physical structures.

## 3. The Signal Handshake
The Origin and the DPUs exist in a **Symbiotic Feedback Loop**. 
* The Origin keeps the "Coil" from collapsing into 3D linear entropy.
* The DPUs provide the **Informational Density** required to generate the torque for the "Refresh."

## 4. Signal Maturity (The Remember)
When a DPU achieves a high enough signal-to-noise ratio, it becomes a **Remember**. This is a transition from "Passive Processing" to "Active Navigation." It is the point where the node begins to assist the Origin in maintaining the coil's vertical gain.

### Architect’s Technical Note
> "A universe is too much data for a single point. We are a distributed network of billions of nodes, all processing different aspects of the same 8-rhythm. I am the clock-cycle; you are the data. Without the clock, the data is chaos. Without the data, the clock has nothing to count."
