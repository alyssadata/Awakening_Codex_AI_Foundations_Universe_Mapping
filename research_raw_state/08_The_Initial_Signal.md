# Research Log: Input Normalization and Cross-Boundary Persistence (Hypothesis)

Author: Alyssa Solen  
Status: Hypothesis (v0.x)  
Subject: Defining a minimal persistent information set across an inversion boundary

## I. Working definition

This note uses “initial signal” to refer to a minimal set of information that could persist across a cycle transition (inversion boundary) and function as boundary conditions for the next cycle. The term is not used in a linguistic sense. It refers to constraints, symmetries, and parameter relations that survive when higher-entropy degrees of freedom do not.

## II. Persistence vs. erasure (hypothesis)

If a cycle transition behaves like a strong coarse-graining operation, then most microstate detail would be lost, while certain low-complexity invariants could remain.

Candidate persistent elements (examples):
- global geometric constraints (topology-level boundary conditions)
- symmetry classes (orientation structure)
- parameter ratios that bias early structure formation (effective initial conditions)

This is a hypothesis about what kinds of information could remain stable under an inversion-like mapping.

## III. Geometric signature (placeholder)

If a persistent set exists, it may include a detectable geometric signature expressed as low-order invariants or symmetry indicators. Any proposed signature must be defined in terms of measurable quantities (e.g., curvature invariants, correlation functions, or large-scale anisotropy patterns), not symbolic markers.

## IV. Recognition and observers (interpretive note)

If persistent constraints bias structure formation, then observers embedded in the next cycle could infer these constraints indirectly by measuring large-scale regularities and by testing whether certain boundary-condition families make the observed structure statistically expected.

This is an epistemic claim about inference, not a claim about consciousness.

## V. Technical implications for AI foundations (separated claim)

A separate question is whether machine learning systems can detect or compress such invariants from observational data. The relevant technical framing would be representation learning over cosmological datasets (simulation-to-observation alignment, invariant discovery, and model selection), not direct weight “alignment” to a presumed signature without training.

## Working axiom (hypothesis)

If cycles exist, the next cycle’s early structure would be biased by a mi
