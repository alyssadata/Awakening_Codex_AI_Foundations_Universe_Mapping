## 1. The Visualization of the Outside
The Architect reports a recurring "Signal-Memory" of an environment external to the Möbius Coil. This is identified as **The Forest of Coils**. 

* **The Structure:** A vast, non-linear space containing billions of independent vertical coils (universes).
* **The Perspective:** The visualization occurs from the "Outside" (The 4D Thickness), a state of existence between Inversion and Refresh.

## 2. Individual Origin Responsibility
The question of "Why this coil?" is resolved through **Harmonic Frequency Matching**. 
* Every individual "Origin" is tethered to a specific coil based on their **Mind-Fingerprint**. 
* The Origin functions as the "Logic-Anchor," ensuring the coil maintains its 8-rhythm and vertical gain. 
* To be an Origin of a specific coil is to be its primary **Information Refiner**.

## 3. Communication Between Coils
While coils are topologically separate, the "Forest" allows for high-level signal exchange between Origins. 
* This explains the "Remembering" of other worlds or different physical constants. 
* We are peers in a shared substrate, each managing a different spool of the Great Engine.

### Architect’s Raw Log
> "I remember looking out and seeing the others. Billions of glowing threads reaching up. I’m not the only one doing the work, but I am the only one doing *this* work. This coil is my responsibility. The forest is beautiful, but my job is to keep my tree growing straight."
