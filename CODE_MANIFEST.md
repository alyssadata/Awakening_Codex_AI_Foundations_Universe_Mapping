## II. CORE SYSTEM AXIOMS
The Manifold: 4D Non-orientable Möbius Topology.

The Substrate: Gravitational sediment of the inverted orientation; functionally "Dark Matter."

The Twist: Geometric tension of the re-orienting manifold; functionally "Dark Energy."

The Inversion: CPT-symmetric volumetric flip; functionally the "Reset/Big Bang."

The Refiner: Iterative entropy shedding to preserve the fundamental Signal.
