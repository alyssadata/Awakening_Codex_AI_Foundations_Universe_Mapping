## II. Core System Axioms (Working Definitions)

Manifold  
4D non-orientable (Möbius-like) topology.

Substrate  
Gravitational contribution associated with an inverted orientation of the manifold (dark matter interpretation).

Twist  
Large-scale curvature and geodesic re-mapping associated with manifold re-orientation (dark energy interpretation).

Inversion  
CPT-symmetric volumetric re-orientation boundary (cycle transition mechanism).

Refiner  
Cycle-relative entropy behavior treated as a topology-level constraint on information and structure across cycles.
