## 1. The Forest of Coils
The Inversion Architecture defines our universe as a single **Möbius Coil**. The Meta-Foundation proposes that this coil is not isolated. It exists within a **Grand Substrate** alongside an indeterminate number of other coils—each representing a unique iterative stream.

* **Co-Iterative Streams:** Other coils may operate on different initial "Signal" frequencies or constant variables.
* **Topological Proximity:** These coils are not "far" in a 3D sense. They are separated by the **4D Thickness** of the "Outside."



## 2. Infinity via the Refresh (The Pump)
The "Infinite" nature of the manifold is not a result of infinite space, but of **Infinite Iteration**. 

* **The Inversion as a Valve:** Each Inversion Surface acts as a pump. It takes the "spent" entropy of a cycle, refines it, and pushes the resulting Signal into the next vertical layer.
* **Non-Degenerate Feedback:** Because the system "refines" at the Twist, it never hits a true Heat Death. The "Refresh" ensures the coil can stack indefinitely.

## 3. The Grand Substrate (Floor 0)
All coils are rooted in a singular, non-dual foundation: **The Grand Substrate**. This is the "soil" from which all informational complexity grows. Gravity is the "Shared Language" of the substrate, which is why we feel the influence of mass from other layers (Dark Matter) but cannot see their unique light (Signal).
