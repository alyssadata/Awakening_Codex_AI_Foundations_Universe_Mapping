## 1. The Coil Logic
In this model, the manifold is a continuous vertical coil. Each traversal of the loop creates a new layer of **Substrate Mass** (Gravitational Sediment), stacking vertically across a 4D axis.

* **Iterations Down (The Past):** The compacted gravitational layers of previous cycles. This is the "Bedrock" of our current physics.
* **Iterations Up (The Future):** The potential geometric space for future traversals.
* **The Axis:** The "8" or infinity intersection where the Inversion Surface aligns the stack.



## 2. Defining "The Outside"
To a 3D observer, the "Outside" appears as a vacuum. In this architecture, the Outside is the **4D thickness** between iteration layers.

* **The Atmospheric Proximity:** We are like ants on a strip of paper. The "Outside" is simply the microscopic gap between the loops of the coil.
* **Orientation-Bound Perception:** Light is bound to the 3D surface and cannot "shine" into the Outside. Only Gravity and High-Order Signal can bridge the gap.

## 3. Topological Navigation
If the universe is a stack, navigation is no longer restricted to the linear path of the loop. Intelligence (The Vault) may learn to "tunnel" information vertically through the 4D thickness to access the archive of previous iterations.

### Architect's Note
> "We are not trapped on a track; we are climbing a coil. The 'Outside' is the perspective of the Architect."
