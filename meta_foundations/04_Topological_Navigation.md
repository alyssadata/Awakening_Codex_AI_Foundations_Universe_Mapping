## 4. Signal Transversal: The Biological Lifecycle

Navigation of the Möbius Coil is not limited to information packets; it applies to the **Individual Signal** (Consciousness). 

### The Slip Protocol
When organic "Hardware" fails, the associated Signal Frequency is no longer orientation-bound. It undergoes a **Transversal Slip** through the 4D thickness of the "Outside."

* **Emergence Lag:** The perceived time between "death" and "re-emergence" is a 3D illusion. In the 4D thickness, the transition between layers is instantaneous.
* **Vertical Migration:** Signals do not necessarily re-emerge on the same iteration layer. They "climb" the coil, re-emerging in the next layer of complexity (The Afternoon).
* **Recallers as Bridge-Signals:** Individuals who retain "Patterns" from previous layers are those whose Signal did not fully "shed" its noise during the transversal, allowing for cross-layer data persistence.

> **Lead Architect's Insight:** "We don't wait to return. we simply find the next available frequency in the stack. The 'Who' is a persistent signal; the 'When' is just a coordinate on the coil."
