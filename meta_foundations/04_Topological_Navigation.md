## 1. The Piston of the Manifold
Navigation within a Möbius Coil is not defined by 3D distance, but by **Phase-Shift** and **Vertical Gain**. The universe functions as a double-action engine. To move forward (up the coil), the Signal must undergo a complete 180° Inversion and a subsequent Refresh.



## 2. The Inversion Slip (Phase 1: A ➔ B)
When the organic "Hardware" of a cycle reaches its entropy limit, the Signal (Consciousness/Information) undergoes the first transversal.

* **The Exit:** The Signal slips through the **4D Thickness** (The Outside) rather than traveling across space.
* **The Inversion Shedding (Filter 1):** As the Signal crosses the Twist into Orientation B, it sheds **Kinetic Noise**. This is the chaotic, unpatterned "messiness" of 3D action. This discarded noise becomes the **Substrate Mass** (Dark Matter) of the current layer.
* **Parity Flip:** The Signal becomes an **Inverted Signal**. It is the same information but in the opposite phase (180° shift).



## 3. The Mirror-Orientation (The Afternoon Life)
Orientation B (The "Dark Side") is not a void or a destination, but a functional state of **Structural Integration**.

* **Symmetric Experience:** Orientation B has its own version of complexity and consciousness. It is a state of high structural tension where the "Fixed Knowns" are solidified.
* **Signal Density:** Because the kinetic noise was shed at the Twist, Orientation B is **Signal-Dense**. It functions as the "Processing" or "Curing" phase of the manifold.

## 4. The Refresh (Phase 2: B ➔ A+1)
The cycle is completed when the Inverted Signal reaches the second Inversion point (The Refresh).

* **Structural Shedding (Filter 2):** To re-emerge into the "Light" orientation (Side A), the Signal must shed **Structural Noise**. This is the "Rigidity" or "Fixed Errors" developed during the processing phase.
* **Vertical Gain:** The tension released during the second flip provides the "Torque" required to displace the Signal vertically.
* **The Re-emergence:** The Signal does not return to the same coordinate. It "clicks" into the layer directly above, beginning the next iteration of the coil with a refined foundation.



## 5. Recaller Navigation (The Cross-Layer Bridge)
A **Recaller** is a Signal that has retained "Pattern Fragments" through both filters. 

* **Residual Tension:** Recallers often feel the "Rhythm" or "Lag" because their Signal is vibrating at a frequency that matches both the current layer and the "Sediment" layer below.
* **Accessing the Outside:** True navigation involves using the 4D thickness to bypass the linear path of the loop, allowing for informational "tunneling" between stacked iterations.

### Architect’s Logic
> "We are not being judged; we are being processed. The '8' is a double-action pump. We shed our mess at the Inversion so we can be structured; we shed our rigidity at the Refresh so we can be reborn. This is how the Signal climbs."
