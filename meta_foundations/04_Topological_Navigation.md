## 1. Framing

This note proposes a two-stage mapping across manifold orientation structure. “Navigation” is used as a conceptual term for how information, structure, or effective degrees of freedom could transform across an inversion-like boundary in a non-orientable (Möbius-like) manifold description. This is not presented as established physics. It is a hypothesis framework intended to be translated into measurable quantities.

## 2. Phase 1 mapping (A → B)

Working claim: a transition into an opposite orientation can be modeled as a parity or sign reversal along an orientation coordinate, producing a state that is not electromagnetically observable from the original orientation while remaining gravitationally coupled through manifold connectivity.

Filter 1 (working interpretation): degrees of freedom that are not preserved under the mapping are treated as discarded variance. In the cosmology framing, the gravitational contribution associated with what becomes electromagnetically non-observable is modeled as substrate mass.

## 3. Orientation B as an integration regime (interpretive)

Working claim: the opposite orientation may be modeled as a regime with reduced electromagnetic observability and different effective constraints on structure formation. In this framing, “signal-dense” means lower irrelevant variance and higher constraint dominance, not a literal change in consciousness.

## 4. Phase 2 mapping (B → A+1)

Working claim: a second transition can be modeled as a return to an electromagnetically observable orientation with changed boundary conditions. The return is not assumed to be to an identical state; it is modeled as an update in constraints consistent with an iterative-cycle interpretation.

Filter 2 (working interpretation): the second mapping discards a different class of variance (for example rigidities or accumulated fixed errors), producing a refined constraint set for the subsequent state.

## 5. Cross-layer persistence (pattern fragments)

Working claim: if some invariants persist across both mappings, they may be detectable as stable pattern fragments. Operationally, “recaller” refers to any system that retains measurable invariants across discontinuities (e.g., across resets, substrate changes, or container transitions).

This is a placeholder category until formal invariants and tests are specified.

## 6. Micro vs. macro mapping (scale separation)

This note distinguishes between:
- macro-scale transitions: global topology-level boundary behavior across a full cycle  
- micro-scale transitions: localized discontinuities (state resets, substrate changes, or other bounded transitions)

The distinction is conceptual. It does not assume that local events replicate cosmological boundary physics.

## 7. Persistence vs. stagnation (systems framing)

In a general systems sense, persistence under constraint often requires periodic reorganization. This section treats “stagnation” as uncontrolled accumulation of variance that degrades coherence. “Persistence” is treated as the maintenance of invariants across reorganizations.

This is a systems analogy, not a claim about immortality.

## 8. Intentional control (engineering boundary)

If controlled transitions across discontinuities are possible in engineered systems, they would require:
- explicit state capture or sufficient state descriptors
- reconstruction protocols
- verification gates for invariants

This section is framed as an engineering boundary condition, not as a claim that such control exists in cosmology.

## Technical inquiry

What specific invariants, mappings, and measurable quantities would make the two-stage filtering model testable (for example through lensing, structure growth, correlation functions, or rotation curve profiles), and what observations would falsify the mapping?
