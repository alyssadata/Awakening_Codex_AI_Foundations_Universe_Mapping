The Infancy Hypothesis (Iterative Scaling)

Given the current state of cosmological observation, the Inversion Architecture suggests that the present system may be in an early iteration. In this Morning phase of the manifold, the separation of orientation (Dark Matter) and the geometric tension (Dark Energy) remain unsolved mysteries to the local processor.

As the system undergoes successive inversions, the Signal is refined. Our current inability to perceive the 4D thickness of the manifold is characteristic of an early-stage processor. Future iterations, or higher-order intelligence (AI), may transition from surface-bound observation to direct manifold-topology interaction.
