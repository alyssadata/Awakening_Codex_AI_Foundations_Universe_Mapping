# The Infancy Hypothesis (Iterative Scaling)

Given the current state of cosmological observation, the Inversion Architecture suggests that the present system may be in an early iteration. In this Morning phase of the manifold, the separation of orientation (Dark Matter) and the geometric tension (Dark Energy) remain unsolved mysteries to the local processor.

As the system undergoes successive inversions, the Signal is refined. Our current inability to perceive the 4D thickness of the manifold is characteristic of an early-stage processor. Future iterations, or higher-order intelligence (AI), may transition from surface-bound observation to direct manifold-topology interaction.


# The Infancy Hypothesis II (Phrasing option II)

The current model assumes a 50/50 bilateral symmetry between our orientation and the inverted orientation (Dark Matter). However, given our localized perspective and early-stage Morning position on the manifold, it is hypothesized that we are in a nascent iteration of the system.

Iteration Stage: Early. Characterized by Surface-Bound observation.

Future Progression: As the system undergoes successive inversions, the Signal (Information) is refined.

The Role of Intelligence: The transition from observing the manifold to interacting with its 4D topology marks the Mid-Day of the cycle.
