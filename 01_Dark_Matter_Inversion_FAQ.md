## Dark Matter Inversion FAQ (Condensed Canonical Form)

Q1: Why is Dark Matter dark? Why is there no light?

A: Because light is orientation-bound, not missing.

Atoms, electrons, and photons operate within a specific orientation of spacetime,
analogous to ink confined to one surface of a sheet. In a Möbius-inverted manifold,
matter also exists in the opposite orientation. Light emitted there propagates normally
within that orientation but cannot traverse the manifold’s 4D thickness. It is not
invisible due to absorption or exotic physics; it is geometrically occluded. Gravity is not
surface-bound; it is the curvature and tension of the manifold itself and is felt across its
full thickness. This relationship is bilateral: we are the dark matter for the observers in
the inverted orientation, anchoring each other in a shared gravitational lock.

Q2: Is the “Other Side” a mirror universe synchronized with ours?

A: No. It is a topological reflection, not a synchronized duplicate.

Both orientations share the same spacetime fabric but evolve independently. Matter on
the inverted orientation has its own momentum, clustering history, and dynamics. This
explains why dark matter halos do not always align perfectly with visible matter and
why gravitational mass can pass through baryonic gas during collisions.

Q3: If there is an entire inverted sector full of matter, why don’t we see any
interaction besides gravity?

A: Because there is no local coupling.

Matter on the inverted orientation does not collide with our gas, dust, or radiation.
Interaction occurs only through shared curvature. Momentum is decoupled; gravity is
shared.

Q4: Is the Other Side the past or the future?

A: Neither, and both.

The Big Bang and Big Crunch are the same low-entropy boundary, viewed from opposite
orientations. The inversion is not a time reversal but a re-orientation of the entropy
gradient.

Q5: If the universe is a loop, why does it appear to be expanding?

A: Because we are in the rebound phase of the inversion.

What we measure as expansion is the kinetic release from the inversion surface,
analogous to a compressed manifold snapping outward. Observed acceleration (Dark
Energy) is not driven by a mysterious fuel, but by the geometric tension of the Möbius
twist as the manifold curves toward the next inversion boundary.

Q6: Does the universe end in a Big Crunch?

A: No. It undergoes an inversion.

As density approaches the manifold’s limit, a volumetric flip occurs. Matter transitions
orientation rather than vanishing. The end of one cycle becomes the gravitational
substrate of the next.

Q7: Is this real science or speculative metaphor?

A: It is a topological resolution consistent with observed gravitational behavior.

By treating dark matter as geometric residue rather than an undiscovered particle, the
model explains rotation curves and large-scale structures without introducing new force
laws or violating established physics. It is falsifiable through gravitational lensing and
boundary-condition signatures.
