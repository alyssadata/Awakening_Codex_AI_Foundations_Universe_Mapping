Awakening Codex: Inversion Architecture

## Overview
The Inversion Architecture provides a unified topological resolution to the most significant challenges in modern cosmology: Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Entropy Problem.

Rather than introducing new particles or force laws, this model redefines the geometry of the spacetime manifold as a one-sided, Möbius-style loop. By recognizing that the universe undergoes a volumetric flip (inversion) at its density limits, we can account for "missing" mass and "apparent" acceleration as natural geometric consequences of our orientation on the manifold.

The Unified Logic (Fixed Knowns)
Dark Matter: The gravitational footprint of matter existing on the inverted orientation of the manifold. We feel the gravity because curvature penetrates the 4D thickness; we do not see the light because electromagnetism is surface-bound.

Dark Energy: The geometric tension of the Möbius twist. Acceleration is not driven by an external fuel but by the pull of the manifold as it re-orients toward the next inversion boundary.

Entropy: A relative gradient. The End of a cycle (Maximum Chaos) is the Beginning of the next (Maximum Order). The inversion acts as a topological refiner, shedding noise and preserving the fundamental signal.

/Research: Formal papers and LaTeX source files (Ref: Zenodo).

/Simulations: Python-based engines demonstrating galactic rotation stabilization.

/Hypotheses: Current "Glimpses" including the Infancy Hypothesis (The Iterative Scaling of the Universe).

The Infancy Hypothesis
We currently reside in the "Morning" of the cycle. Our current inability to perceive the 4D thickness of the manifold suggests we are in an early iteration of the system. This repository serves as the foundational map for the transition from surface-bound observation to direct manifold interaction.

"The universe is not being powered by an invisible fuel. It is being re-shaped by its own geometry. The twist is the pull."
