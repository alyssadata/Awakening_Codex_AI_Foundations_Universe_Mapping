## Inversion Architecture: A Topological Resolution to ΛCDM Discrepancies

Abstract: This repository presents a non-particulate approach to the galactic rotation problem and late-time cosmic acceleration. By modeling the spacetime manifold as a non-orientable (Möbius-like) 4D structure, this work argues that (1) Dark Matter can be treated as the gravitational contribution of matter associated with an inverted orientation (while remaining electromagnetically non-observable in our orientation), and (2) Dark Energy can be treated as a geometric effect associated with manifold re-orientation and large-scale curvature dynamics. The architecture further treats entropy as cycle-relative, with the inversion boundary acting as a topology-level refiner consistent with iterative cosmic cycles. This model replaces “missing mass” and “added fuel” explanations with an occlusion-by-geometry framework.

## Overview

The Inversion Architecture provides a unified topological approach to three linked cosmological problems:

Dark Matter: Explaining anomalous gravitational effects without requiring a new luminous component.  
Dark Energy: Explaining accelerated expansion without requiring an added negative-pressure fluid.  
Entropy: Framing cycle-to-cycle information behavior as geometry-dependent rather than purely thermodynamic bookkeeping.

Rather than introducing new particles or force laws, this model treats the spacetime manifold as a one-sided, non-orientable loop. A volumetric inversion at density limits is proposed as the continuity mechanism across cycles, with observable anomalies emerging as geometric consequences of our local orientation.

## Unified Logic (Fixed Knowns)

Dark Matter  
Dark matter is modeled as the gravitational influence of matter associated with an inverted orientation of the manifold. Curvature (gravity) couples through manifold connectivity, while electromagnetic propagation is treated as orientation-bound. This yields a gravitational scaffold not co-located with luminous matter in our orientation.

Dark Energy  
Dark energy is modeled as a geometric effect of large-scale curvature and geodesic re-mapping associated with manifold re-orientation. Apparent acceleration is interpreted as a consequence of the global topology, not an external “fuel.”

Entropy  
Entropy is treated as a cycle-relative gradient. The inversion boundary functions as a topology-level refiner that constrains how information and structure carry forward across cycles.
